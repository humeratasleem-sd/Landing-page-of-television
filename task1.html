    <p>Television is based on a highly sophisticated science of vision and sound. A man can see as far the horizon. He hears as far as the sound is audible to him. But television takes his vision to a place far beyond his horizon. He sees a thing or person long beyond his actual physical reach. It brings to him also sound from a very remote place.

      In fact, television brings vision and sound together from a distance which is beyond the range of human sight and hearing. It is a powerful and very useful invention of modern science. It has conquered space for human eye-sight. It has brought about a great development in the science of communication. It can well be used for entertainment and knowledge.</p>

      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/LED_TV_01.jpg" alt="LED TV" />
      <p>
        LED TVs use light-emitting diodes for backlighting the display, offering better brightness and energy efficiency than older LCDs. This technology allows for thinner panels, better color accuracy, and improved contrast ratios.
      </p>
      <p>
        LED TVs have become the standard for home entertainment, offering a balance between cost and performance. They come in various sizes and resolutions, suitable for most budgets.

      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/OLED_Display_01.jpg" alt="OLED TV" />
      <p>
        OLED TVs use organic light-emitting diodes that emit their own light, which enables perfect blacks and incredible contrast ratios. This technology provides superior picture quality, wider viewing angles, and vibrant colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        OLED screens are ultra-thin and flexible, allowing innovative designs. Though generally more expensive, OLED TVs are favored by enthusiasts for their premium display quality.

      <p>
        QLED TVs feature a quantum dot layer that enhances color and brightness, combined with LED backlighting technology. Mainly promoted by Samsung, QLED TVs offer vivid colors and high brightness ideal for bright room viewing.
      </p>
      <p>
        These TVs bridge the gap between standard LED and OLED technology, delivering excellent picture quality with some advantages in durability and brightness.
